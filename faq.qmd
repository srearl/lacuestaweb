## How do I request a key to the tennis courts?

Keys to the tennis courts have been issued to all homeowners of record and are to be transferred to new homeowners as a part of the sale / purchase of a Casa Buena property.  Replacement keys may be purchased for \$25 each.  Please contact any member of the Board of Directors to request replacement keys.

## Is parking a boat, RV or trailer on my property allowed?


There are restrictions for parking boats, RV's, and trailers within the community.  These items must be concealed from public view and cannot be parked on the street.  The community CC&R's clearly define these restrictions and subject the homeowner to fines for violation.

## What happens if I do not pay my assessment?

The maintenance and management services incurred by the Association are dependent upon timely receipt of the assessments due from each homeowner. Late payments will result in a late charge as assessments are due on the first of the month. In addition, the CC&Râ€™s allows the Association to charge late charges and interest and proceed with a lien on your property, or foreclosure proceeding for nonpayment of assessments.
